          <p>When we meet someone in person,
            it may take 3-7 seconds for them to pass a judgment on us.
            During these few seconds they decide whether or not they
            would want to have a business relationship with us.
            On the internet, our websites function Pretty much the same
            way and we should try to make our visitors first impression,
            a lasting impression.
            During the recent years, this snippet of time has been even more restricting.
            If a website is slow to load for instance,
            a vistor may not even wait for a couple extra seconds for the website to respond and they would navigate away.. </p>
